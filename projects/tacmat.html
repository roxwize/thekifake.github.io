<h1 id="tacm">TACM</h1>
<p><strong>TACM</strong> is a fake terminal emulator written in JavaScript. It is modular and extensible, meaning you can add your own functions and change its behaviour with ease. TACM is a recursive acronym, and it stands for <strong>*T</strong>ACM: <strong>A</strong> <strong>C</strong>ommandline <strong>M</strong>odule*.</p>
<h2 id="tacmat">TACMat</h2>
<p>TACMat is the formatting syntax used by TACM to render styled HTML code from simple raw text. Here is an example:</p>
<p><code>This is an |B|example|/B| for |U|TACMat|/U|</code></p>
<p>The usefulness of TACMat comes not in its specification but in its use in TACM. Every <em>marktype</em>, the kind of element surrounded in pipes, can be given its own class and have its default class overwritten. As an example, <code>|DIR|root@tasm|/DIR|</code> can be given the &quot;k-dir&quot; class in the TACMat configuration settings. In this case, DIR is the marktype.</p>
<p>TACMat comes with four default marktypes: <strong>B</strong>old, <strong>I</strong>talic, <strong>U</strong>nderline, and <strong>S</strong>trikethrough. When placed by themselves, they will return a <code>span</code> element with an inline style for that specific marktype. Regardless, they can still be given respective classes.</p>
<h3 id="giving-marktypes-classes">Giving marktypes classes</h3>
<p>Marktypes are given classes via an argument passed into functions that accept TACMat markup. The structure is incredibly simple: you pass in the lowercase marktype as the key, and the class it corresponds to as the value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  dir: &quot;k-dir&quot;,
  big: &quot;big-text&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If this were to be passed into a function that accepts TACMat syntax, it would replace all content inside of <code>|DIR| |/DIR|</code> with a span whose class is &quot;k-dir.&quot; It would also replace all content inside of <code>|BIG| |/BIG|</code> with a span whose class is &quot;big-text.&quot;</p>
